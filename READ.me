**Project 1: Loan Defaulter Prediction Model (Finance - Predictive Analytics)**
📌 Repository Name: Loan_Predictor

**Overview**
This project is a predictive analytics model designed to classify loan applicants into defaulters and non-defaulters using machine learning. The goal is to help financial institutions assess credit risk and optimize loan approvals.

✅ Completed as part of the Xaltius Data Science Internship
✅ Used 4 ML models, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy (68.8%)
✅ Built an end-to-end data science pipeline covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation

**Dataset**
Source: A subset of Bajaj FinServ's financial dataset (some columns removed for privacy).
Size: 5,000 records, 17 features.
Key Features: Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Loan Term, Credit Score, Employment Type, Income Level.
Target Variable: default_status (1 = Default, 0 = Non-Default).

**Data Exploration & Key Insights**
📊 Imbalance in Default Status: 80% non-defaulters, 20% defaulters.
📊 Feature Importance: Loan Amount, Interest Rate, and Credit Score are the strongest predictors of default.
📊 Outliers Detected: High-interest rates had significant outliers, indicating potential risk customers.
